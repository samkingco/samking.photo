          I started out my journey with a camera in 2007, mostly shooting the
          action sports scene in the UK. When the magazines started going
          online, I moved into a career of design and coding, but kept shooting
          for myself. My photographic interests have since moved away from the
          action and towards the stillness of landscapes and environments.

          I recently took a break from my design career and I'm getting back to
          making photo work more full-time. I'm currently exploring my heritage,
          and also how the world can feel to an Autistic person like myself.
